# HTTP API

Sensei exposes an http api for you to manage your node from.  Data sent to and received from the api will be structured using JSON.

## Authentication
Please see the [Authentication](/authentication) section for more details on how to properly authenticate your requests.

## Host

The service is exposed on the host your node is deployed on.  For accessing locally you should likely `127.0.0.1`.  If you are trying to access your node remotely you'll need to find out what hostname to use.

## Port

The default port is set to `5401` but you are free to expose the api over any port you wish.

# Get Started

While Sensei is in beta the only way to install is it to build it yourself from source.  When a stable release is ready we will publish binaries for major platforms and release apps for the popular node-in-a-box providers.

### Dependencies

You will need rust to build Sensei.  If you need instructions for how to set this up on your machine please see the [rust-lang instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Currently Sensei requires bitcoind with an electrum server running in order to work.  Before the 1.0 release we plan to support more backends.

### Install and run Sensei

- Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:L2-Technology/sensei.git`
- Move into the directory `cd sensei`
- Run from source `cargo run --bin senseid -- --network=regtest`

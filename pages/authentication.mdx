# Authentication

Sensei uses macaroons and tokens for authentication. On the first startup Sensei will generate an admin token.  The admin token will allow access to all of the api endpoints.  A token or macaroon needs to be included in all api requests to properly authenticate the request.

Currently Sensei only supports the single `macaroon` file but in a future version it will support more fine-grained access control. 

### HTTP API

A macaroon or admin token value must be included either in an HTTP Header or HTTP Cookie with name `macaroon` or `token`. 

Sensei exposes a `/v1/login` and `/v1/logout` endpoints that can be used to set and remove the macaroon cookie automatically.  The `login` endpoint requires the node's `username` and `passphrase` to authenticate and the response will include a `Set-Cookie` header that contains the admin macaroon.

### GRPC API

The macaroon value must be set as part of the request metadata using the key `macaroon`.
